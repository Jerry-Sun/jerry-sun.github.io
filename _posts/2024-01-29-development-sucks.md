Everyone talks up developing countries like the next best thing on Earth. But it's easy to talk about from someone sitting behind a cushy desk job. In practice, industrialization sucks.

In India or Vietnam, the negative externalities were everywhere. The air was unbreathable. The roads were congested. Itineraries needed to be frequently re-routed. Several complained to me about how this was wasteful money that wasn't being distributed to the poor. Keep in mind in India in particular, this is a country where politicians have to balance things like infrastructure buildup with keeping their voter base happy.

In Mumbai, my Airbnb host was a nice family who complained about how all the construction meant the nature in and around the city was destroyed. How bird migration was affected by the changes. How the peace of the city was disturbed by the sounds of banging everywhere. Or how the local farmers market down the street they'd frequent was shut down and replaced by a fancy supermarket that didn't sell fresh produce.

These reminded of a story I once read about China's development in the 90's. This is from a Chinese individual answering a question about why Chinese now by and large support their government today.

> Back when the country was poor as f\*\*k, the government started to build highways and railways, instead of handing out free stuff to the poor.

> We were unhappy. A newspaper commentator wrote: “It would have been funny to see, decades later, excessive trains tour the country with cars of empty seats.”

> Today last minute tickets are hard to come by during holidays. Trains are almost always full.

> When they built roads, we were sneering: one more excuse for officials to take bribe! Building stuff we won't be using.

> Today we complain the roads aren't wide enough because of the traffic jam.

> Leadership changes during the span of these mega projects, but the followthrough was steady.

> Year after year, the Chinese government does its job. It hasn't changed much about this. The only thing that changed, is that we the people living under its governance, stopped complaining as much as we used to.

> Because compared to decades ago, we do, actually, live at a higher standard.

In my travels, I always made a mental note of the parallels between life in developing countries today and that in China a few decades back. Arriving to that higher living standard will inevitably happen but the months and years getting there are very tough.
