_I started writing during which I came up with the software analogy. I ended up scrapping what I had written for this tighter thought but I'll retain the draft below. This is the first part of a series of musings on renewable energy models_

The global shift to renewable energy is running software's move from one-time sales to recurring subscriptions in reverse.

Energy currently is a subscription model. Countries dependent on energy imports need to consistently import energy from net energy exporters. This means a steady trade of outbound capital in exchange for inbound energy, like monthly purchases of a SaaS product.

The introduction of renewables shifts energy to public goods. Every country has access to solar and wind energy. So the principal limitation won't be the natural resource itself but storage. Energies harnessed at the point of collection will be used to power homes and other national needs while excess energy will be stored in batteries, which are getting better and cheaper.

Purchases of batteries are more like one-time purchases of software. Once a purchase is made, a battery can do its job and last several years. That is, the revenue opportunity is the marginal need for renewable energy. Furthermore, reliance on a limited set of providers won't be necessary. A country can import wind turbines, solar panels, or batteries from multiple manufacturers. Imagine Ethiopia buying panels from the United States, China, Germany, India, Vietnam, Russia, and more. Lowering dependency is great for the buyer and limits leverage for the seller.

This will disadvantage China, which has invested heavily in solar, wind, and battery technology. If I had to bet on a horse, I'd bet that China will have the cheapest renewable energy products on the market. They'll work to develop and then export their renewable technology to foreign countries. They're already doing that. But dominating the energy market in the future doesn't seem like it'll be as lucrative or geopolitically advantageous as it was for countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia in the past.
