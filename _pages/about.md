Hey there. Welcome to my page.

I'm a research analyst at <a href="https://www.messari.io">Messari</a>, a crypto investment research and data analytics firm based in New York.

My crypto research interests include decentralized finance, real-world applications, and on-chain credentialing. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing supporting my Seattle sports teams and traveling, the latter of which you'll find in the <a href="https://www.jerrysun.me/travels">Travels</a> tab.
